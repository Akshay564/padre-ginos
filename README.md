# Padre Gino's üçï

Order pizza (although you won't actually get one... üòÜ)

## Overview

Padre Gino's is a fun pizza ordering web app built with Vite, React, TanStack Query, and TanStack Routing. The main purpose is to let you "order" pizza‚Äîjust for the experience!

This project depends on a backend service for database functionality. The backend is required for the app to function, but was **not built by me**.

## Tech Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ‚Äì lightning-fast development environment
- [React](https://react.dev/) ‚Äì UI library
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) ‚Äì server state management
- [TanStack Routing](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) ‚Äì flexible routing
- **Backend** (`backend/api`) ‚Äì Node.js/Express (external, required for DB)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshay564/padre-ginos.git
cd padre-ginos
```

### 2. Install and run the backend

```bash
cd backend/api
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start (by default, on port 3000).

### 3. Install and run the frontend

Open a new terminal in the root folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
